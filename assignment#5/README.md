## Assigment#5

#### This assignment is designed to have you practice building more complex HTML and CSS layouts.  We will continue to iterate on your previous Assignment 4 Music App static and dynamic web content.

#### You are asked to update the design of your fictional Music App.  This time, instead of displaying your products in an HTML table, you will create visual product “cards” that show an image, song name, year, and duration.

#### You must do all the work for this assignment on your own.  You may consult your notes, use the web for inspiration, but you should not copy code directly from other sites, or other students.  If you need help, ask your professor.
