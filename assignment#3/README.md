## Assignment#3

#### You are asked to create an educational/informational website about your favourite musical artist or genre. You will pick a musical artist/genre and research this online. You will then create a multimedia website that uses resources about your chosen musical artiste/genre (e.g., images, audio, and video) from open web archives.

#### The web is full of both proprietary and open-licensed resources. The former cannot be reused by you: you can’t take an image or logo from someone else’s site and use it on your own. This is a copyright violation. However, there are also many open resources that you can copy and reuse. Learning how to find and use these correctly is important when building your own web content.
