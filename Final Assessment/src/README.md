## Final Assesment

### HTML

#### index.html: my main landing page. This page should give a short description of the game, include some media (e.g., images, videos, YouTube embed iframes) about the game, and provide details and links to other parts of the site (i.e., make sure the user understands how to use the site and what is included).

#### At the bottom of the page, include an HTML Form for the user to enter their email address and join the site’s Newsletter.

##### A single Input element to enter their email. Choose the most appropriate control type and attributes.

##### A hidden Input element with your name. It won’t be shown to the user but will be submitted with the form data.

##### A “Join” Button that submits the form. When the form is submitted, it should POST to https://httpbin.org/post, and only allow the user to submit when a valid email address has been entered.

#### info.html: a page that gives more detailed information about the game

##### the history of the game

##### the rules of game play and/or a description of how to play the game

##### your best tips and strategies for winning

#### reviews.html: a dynamic page with other people’s reviews of playing the game.
