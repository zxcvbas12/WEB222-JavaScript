          Relative newcomers to the Koprulu sector, the terrans are the <br />
          descendants of a disastrous colonization expedition launched <br />

          of the protoss nor the natural prowess of the zerg, terran military
          forces <br />
          rely on a varied mix of resilient, versatile units to outwit their
          foes.
