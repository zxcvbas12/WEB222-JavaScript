      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am Nam Jiho. I was born on September 23, 1999, and I grew up in South
        Korea. However, I am currently living in Toronto. I am studying computer
        programming at Seneca College. My interest in computers and programming
        started when I was young, and I have been passionately studying ever
        since. I find infinite possibilities and joy in solving problems and
        creating through programming. I have a particular interest in paying
        attention to details and creating efficient and robust software.
        Additionally, I value collaboration and communication, actively
        participating in team projects and striving for smooth collaboration
        with team members. I will continue to pursue self-development and
        embrace new technologies and challenges. My goal is to contribute to
        society and create innovative solutions through computer programming.

    <div id="why">
      <h3>why I chose this game</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to create a website about StarCraft because it holds a special
        place in my heart. When I was younger, I used to play StarCraft with my
        friends frequently, and it became a cherished memory of our time
        together. The game not only provided us with hours of fun and excitement
        but also strengthened our bond as we strategized and competed against
        each other. Beyond my personal connection, StarCraft is a game that has
        garnered a massive following worldwide. It has a passionate community of
        players who love and appreciate the depth and complexity of the
        gameplay. Knowing that so many people around the globe share the same
        enthusiasm for the game makes it even more special to me. Moreover,
        StarCraft has become an iconic part of gaming history. Its influence on
        the real-time strategy genre and esports cannot be understated. The
        game's competitive scene has produced legendary players and
        unforgettable moments, further solidifying its status as a gaming
        classic. By creating this website, I hope to share my love for StarCraft
        with others and provide a platform where both veterans and newcomers can
        come together to learn, discuss, and relive the excitement of this
        incredible game. Whether you're a seasoned player or someone curious
        about the game's legacy, I aim to provide valuable information and
        foster a sense of community around this timeless masterpiece.
