## Final Assesment

### JavaScript

#### When the page loads, use the review data in data.js to generate one card per review. For example, the date of the review is a date, so use the most appropriate HTML element type and format. Also, the rating is a number, but you could show it visually (e.g., 3 could be shown as ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆).

#### Below the final review, include an HTML Form that allows a new review to be added. Include appropriate HTML Input elements to enter all the necessary fields for a review and use the correct Input Attributes. When the user clicks a “Create” button at the bottom of the form, use JavaScript to add a new Object to the reviewData Array, then re-generate all the review cards (i.e., clear the cards and reshow them, including the new review just added).
